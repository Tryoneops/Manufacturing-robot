# Automated Food Storage Robot –  Tinkercad Design

##  Project Overview

This project aims to **automate a food storage warehouse** using a linear robotic system, designed in **Tinkercad**, where **robotic arms** handle food boxes along a single-line shelf or conveyor belt — with **zero human intervention**.

##  Execution Algorithm

```plaintext
1. Start the system.
2. Detect a task (store or retrieve a food item).
3. Identify the location of the target box (via sensors or database).
4. Assign the closest robotic arm along the line.
5. Move the robotic arm to pick up the box.
6. Transport the box to its target location (storage zone, conveyor, or output).
7. Repeat from step 2.
